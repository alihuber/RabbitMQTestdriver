# RabbitMQTestdriver
A little Java GUI to send messages to a running RabbitMQ message broker.


## Build instructions
It's a standard NetBeans project.
### Dependencies
Depends on Java version 8 (uses lambda expressions, compiled with Java 1.8.0_40) and depends on the [rabbitmq-client.jar](https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html).

### Generated .jar
After successful build you should have a standalone, startable RabbitMQTestdriver.jar in the `dist/` directory.
